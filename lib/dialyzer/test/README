-------------------------------
To add test cases in any suite:
-------------------------------

  1) If the test requires dialyzer to analyze a single file place it in the
     suite's 'src' directory. If analysis of more files is needed place them
     all in a new directory in suite's 'src' directory.

  2) Create a file with the same name as the test (if single file, omit the
     extension else directory name) containing the expected result in suite's
     'result' directory.

  3) Run './remake <suite>', where <suite> is the suite's name omitting 
     "_tests_SUITE".

----------------------
To create a new suite:
----------------------

  1) Create a directory with the suffix 'tests_SUITE_data'. The name should 
     describe the suite.

  2) In the suite's directory create subdirectories 'src' and 'results' as
     well as a 'dialyzer_options' file with the following content:

        {dialyzer_options, List}.
        {time_limit, Limit}.

        where:

        List  = a list of dialyzer options. Common case will be something
                like [{warnings, Warnings}], where Warnings is a list of valid
                '-W' prefixed dialyzer options without the 'W' prefix (e.g.
                '-Wfoo' would be declared as [{warnings, [foo]}].
        Limit = the amount of time each test case is allowed to run. Must be
                bigger than the time it takes the most time-consuming test to
                finish.
     
     Any of these lines may be missing. Default options list is empty and
     default time limit is 1 minute.

  3) Add tests as described in previous section.

  4) Add the resulting suite's name in the Makefile's MODULES variable.
